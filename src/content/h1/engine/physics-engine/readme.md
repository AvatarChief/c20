title: Physics engine
---
The physics engine of Halo 1 is an in-house implementation which simulates the movement of dynamic objects like [units](~unit), [items](~item), [projectiles](~projectile), and [point_physics](~) dynamics systems like [particle_system](~) and [weather_particle_system](~). Unlike [Halo 2](~h2) and later titles, Halo 1 does _not_ use any middleware like [Havok][].

Different object interactions are simulated in different ways. For example, vehicles use [physics](~) to drive themselves, collide with scenery and the BSP, and collide with other vehicles, but their [model_collision_geometry](~) is used in collisions with projectiles, bipeds, and particles. The [scenario_structure_bsp](~) collision BSP is tested differently for vehicles and projectiles than it is for players, making [phantom BSP](~scenario_structure_bsp#phantom-bsp) more apparent.

# Limits
Vehicles cannot exist below approximately -4,950 world units in the Z (vertical) axis. Vehicles spawned at this extreme distance will sit on an invisible floor and return to the floor if moved below. This is not far from the -5,000 world unit [limit](~renderer#limits) for the game camera. Vehicles can freely move beyond 5,000 units in a horizontal axis.

The following are related [functions](~scripting#functions) that you can use in your scenario scripts and/or [debug globals](~scripting#external-globals) that you can enter into the developer console for troubleshooting.
