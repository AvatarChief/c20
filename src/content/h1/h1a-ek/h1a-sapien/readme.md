{% alert %}
This is an article about the H1A Sapien for use with MCC, for the legacy Sapien for [Halo: Custom Edition](~h1) see [Sapien (2004)](~hek/sapien). You may also be interested in a [summary of changes](~h1a-ek#sapien) from legacy Sapien.
{% /alert %}

**H1A Sapien**, part of the [H1A-EK](~), is a visual [scenario](~) and
[BSP](~scenario_structure_bsp) editor used to populate levels with objects,
configure BSP [cluster data](~scenario_structure_bsp#clusters-and-cluster-data) like wind and sound environments, compile [scripts](~scripting), and more. Sapien shares some systems with Halo itself, including its AI system to support interactive AI scripting and debugging.

It is roughly analagous to Forge found in later Halo titles, although the user cannot interact with the world as a player. Users primarily interact with Sapien's windows and menus, but the _Game Window_ also includes a [scripting console](~developer-console).

# Getting legacy debug_objects
If you prefer legacy Sapien's `debug_objects 1` default appearance, simply set the following globals:

```consoleh1a
debug_objects_collision_models 1
debug_objects_bounding_spheres 1
debug_objects_root_node 0
```

You can even place these in your `editor_init.txt` so they are run automatically at startup.

# Command line flags
Command line flags can be passed to H1A Sapien at launch to change run-time behavior. These features are experimental and might not work as expected.

* `-multipleinstance` command line flag can be used to allow multiple instances of Sapien to be launched at once.
* `-data_dir` and `-tags_dir` can be used to change the tags and data directories. See [using custom content paths](~mod-tools#using-custom-content-paths).

# Menu options
## Switch BSP
It is common for singleplayer scenarios to be comprised of multiple [BSPs](~scenario_structure_bsp). The _Edit > Switch BSP_ option is used to change between them. **Always use this option to switch BSPs** and don't use [`switch_bsp`](~scripting#functions-switch-bsp) in the [console](~developer-console). The menu option performs additional functions that maintain proper editor state, whereas `switch_bsp` is intended for level scripts.

# Windows
## Game window
The game window is the main interface when interacting with objects in the level. It is also where you can run commands by pressing the {% key "~" /%} (tilde) key. The resolution and aspect ratio cannot be adjusted.

Movement of the camera is done in the same way as the in-game debug camera; **hold the middle mouse button**  (unless you lock the mouse) plus:

* Use the mouse to aim
* Move with {% key "W" /%}, {% key "A" /%}, {% key "S" /%}, and {% key "D" /%}
* Go up with {% key "R" /%} and down with {% key "F" /%}
* Increase camera speed by scrolling down or pressing {% key "Shift" /%}
* Decrease camera speed by scrolling up
* Temporarily boost camera speed by holding {% key "Ctrl" /%} (new in H1A Sapien)

Camera rotation with the {% key "G" /%} key is only supported in-game and not in Sapien. If you have accidentally opened the singleplayer pause menu, it can be closed again with {% key "Middle mouse + Escape" /%}.

New in H1A Sapien, you can also use a gamepad to control the camera:

* {% key "Right stick click" /%}: toggle gamepad control
* {% key "Right stick" /%}: aiming
* {% key "Left stick" /%}: horizontal movement
* {% key "Right trigger" /%}: move up
* {% key "Left trigger" /%}: move down
* {% key "Left stick click" /%}: speed boost
* {% key "D-pad up/down" /%}: speed increase/decrease (make sure to enable `framerate_throttle 1` first)

Known issues with gamepad camera control include low aiming sensitivity, lack of stick deadzones, slowness of vertical movement, and speed control framerate dependence.

## Hierarchy view
The Hierarchy view displays all the objects currently placed in the game and organizes them by type. The left pane of the window shows the Hierarchy tree and currently selected type, and the right pane shows the objects of this selected group or type that are currently placed in the level.

## Tool window
This window contains settings for the currently active tool mode, such as object placement, detail object painting, or cluster properties application. The currently active tool depends on the selected hierarchy view item.

The most commonly used settings, or options that are modified the most, are the options under the _Active marker handles_ section and the _Don't draw center marker_ option.

## Properties palette
The Properties palette window displays the properties for the currently selected hierarchy item. The type of object can be changed or chosen in this display as well as various other properties such as the position and rotation of the object, and spawn flags that set various attributes for the object. When applying cluster properties, the camera location in the game window determines the active cluster shown in this window.

If this window doesn't let you interact with it and plays a Windows alert sound when you try, you have an invalid field. Look for which field is being highlighted and correct it (e.g. change `-0` rotation to just `0`).

## Output window
This window is unused and can be ignored.

# Keyboard shortcuts/hotkeys
Some of these shortcuts are only used in certain windows or editor modes.

## General
* {% key "~" /%}: Opens the command console, pressing it again or pressing {% key "enter" /%} on an empty console will close it.
* {% key "Space" /%}: clones the selected object to the camera's location and orientation. If multiple objects are selected, uses the first.
* {% key "Pause/Break" /%}: Pauses your Sapien instance. Press "OK" in the opened window to resume Sapien.
* {% key "Control + B" /%}: Open the BSP switch dialog window.
* {% key "Control + Shift + B" /%}: Creates the file `baggage.txt`. If you end up getting a maximum tag slots error or are [running low on tag space](~map#limits), this file shows the memory usage of tags in the editor.
* {% key "Shift + Click" /%}: Select a group of objects or keep previously placed objects selected. You can also use it to select the first and last object in the hierarchy list to select everything in-between at once. Useful for deleting multiple objects or moving them all at once.
* {% key "Control + Click" /%}: Select a group of objects or keep previously placed objects selected. This will only select the object you specifically click in the hierarchy list. Useful for deleting multiple objects or moving them all at once.
* Hold {% key "Tab" /%}: Using this key combo while having an object selected will set the rotation gizmo to sync with the local rotation of the object. Only really useful if "Local Axes" is not enabled.
* In the hierarchy view, pressing a key will cycle through all folders that start with that character. For example, pressing {% key "A" /%} while having the "Missions" folder expanded will immediately take you to the "AI" folder.
* {% key "N" /%}: This hotkey will snap a selected object to the normal of the ground below it.

## Encounters and AI
* {% key "Middle mouse + F1" /%}: Selects the spawned actor in the center of the game view.
* {% key "Middle mouse + F2" /%} Select next encounter. You can also use the console command `ai_select <encounter>`.
* {% key "Middle mouse + F3" /%}: Select previous encounter.
* {% key "Middle mouse + F4" /%}: When an encounter is selected, selects the next actor.
* {% key "Middle mouse + Shift + F4" /%}: Selects the previous actor.
* {% key "Middle mouse + F5" /%}: Cycles through render modes for actor sprays:
  * Actions
  * Activation status
  * None
* {% key "Middle mouse + F6" /%}: Erase all _spawned_ actors, e.g. those created with `ai_place`.
* {% key "M" /%}: Toggles group labels on [firing positions](~ai#firing-positions), shows the default actor for move positions used by a squad instance, and highlights [editor gizmos/placeholders](~placeholder), making them easier to see.

## Recorded animations
These hotkeys apply in scripted camera mode.

* {% key "A" /%}: Toggle "Attach camera to unit" option.
* {% key "E" /%}: Toggle "Edit camera point" option.
* {% key "C" /%}: Toggle "Scripted camera control".
* {% key "Space" /%}: Creates a new camera point at the game view camera's location if "Edit camera point" is disabled. If "Edit camera point" is enabled then it instead moves the "Active camera point" to the camera's location.
* {% key "Shift + V" /%}: Using this key combo while in scripted camera mode will take over (posess) the selected unit.
* {% key "Backspace" /%}: Cycles through camera types for the posessed unit:
  * First person
  * Third person
  * Flycam
* {% key "Caps lock" /%}: Start/stop animation recording. This requires an Xinput controller (e.g. An Xbox controller) to be connected to your device.
* {% key "Shift + Q" /%}: Exits a posessed unit while in scripted camera mode.

See main page: [recorded-animations](~)

## Detail objects painting
* {% key "Shift + Right Click" /%}: Erases all detail objects in a highlighted cell.
* {% key "Shift + Control + Right Click" /%}: As above, but also deleted the cell itself.
* {% key "Shift + Control + L" /%}: Relight detail objects (useful after updating [lightmaps](~)).

# Radiosity
Both Tool and Sapien can be used to generate [lightmaps](~). Using H1A Tool is suggested for all but the simplest lightmaps or debugging as it doesn't require as many resources or for the window to be in-focus.  To use Sapien, enter the following console commands:

```consoleh1a
;0 for low quality, 1 for high, or a value like 0.8
radiosity_quality 1
;begins radiosity. numbers will start to count down
radiosity_start
;wait for the numbers to count down to 0 or near 0, then:
radiosity_save
```

If you want progress feedback updated more frequently, you can set `radiosity_step_count 1`. See [Tool's lightmaps documentation](~h1a-tool#lightmaps) for an explanation of the `radiosity_quality` value. Using [H1A tool](~h1a-tool) with asserts disabled is **strongly recommended** for high quality lightmaps since it is easier to control the stop parameter (when to save) and is faster than using Sapien.

# editor_init.txt
At startup, Sapien will load `editor_init.txt` if present in the same folder. This file can contain [console commands](~developer-console), one per line, which are executed automatically for you. For example:

```inittxt
sound_enable 0
debug_objects 1
;a comment
```

# Compatibility

Sapien requires DX11 support, it is currently unknown if it can be run under WINE.

# Troubleshooting
## Interface

{% table %}
* Issue
* Solution
---
* Child windows are not visible or stuck outside the main window.
* Open the registry key `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\i343\halo1a_sapien` using regedit and delete all entries ending with "rect".
---
* Clicking the _Edit Types_ button doesn't open a window.
* Delete `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\i343\halo1a_sapien` in regedit.
---
* Can't change the open scenario
* This is a known issue, simply close Sapien and open it again; this will allow you to open the scenario.
---
* Mouse is locked to game view
* Issue/feature with some keyboard layouts, press the middle mouse button to unlock it.
