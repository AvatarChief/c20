**Guerilla** is a visual [tag](~tags) editor. Although it can visualize [bitmaps](~bitmap) and play sounds, it is primarily focused on editing and viewing the structured fields which comprise tags. It does not offer in-game previews or interactive placement of [objects](~object), which is [Sapien's](~sapien) role.

# Saved workspaces
Using _File > Save/Load Workspace_, you can save and reload a file which contains the current state of open tags and their window positions. Guerilla automatically creates a file `guerilla.cfg` with the last window state when closed.

# Known issues
The "Show HUD" window for [unit_hud_interface](~) tags does not work as intended.
