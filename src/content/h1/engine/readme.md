The Halo 1 iteration of [Blam!](~blam) 

By 2001's standards, the engine and asset tools were fairly innovative and powerful, combining techniques like portal-based occlusion, radiosity, particles, AI and pathfinding, dynamic physics, advanced shaders, and a scripting engine. It was written in C and C++.

Note that on Xbox, the engine makes some in-memory [tag edits](~tool#hardcoded-tag-patches) for balancing.

The Halo engine was not just used for the Halo series. Bungie co-founder [Alex Seropian][alex] went on to found [Wideload Games][wideload] and used the engine for [Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse][stubbs] as well as a prototype of [Hail to the Chimp][chimp-proto]. In fact, it is possible to extract [tags](~) from Stubbs using [Refinery](~mek) and recompile levels for Halo.

Another lesser-known use was in the [Shadowrun prototype][shadowrun-prototype].
