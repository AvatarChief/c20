**invader-edit-qt** is a GUI [tag](~tags) editor included in the [Invader](~) project. It is similar to [Guerilla](~h1a-guerilla).

# Usage
See [official documentation][docs] for usage instructions. Note that the `--no-safeguards` option should be avoided unless you have a very good reason to edit parts of tag data which are usually protected.
