**Chimera** is a game client modification for Halo Custom Edition, PC "Retail", and Trial which extends limits, addresses some [renderer issues](~renderer#gearbox-regressions), and applies dozens of fixes and quality of life improvements like [map downloads](~sharing#halonet). See its [features list][github-feat] for more information.

# Installation
1. Back up your game's original `Strings.dll`. Renaming it to `strings-old.dll` works.
2. Copy `strings.dll`, `chimera.ini`, and `fonts` from the Chimera download into your game folder.
3. Configure personal preferences in `chimera.ini` if desired.

# Compatibility
Current vesions of Chimera are incompatible with [OpenSauce](~) and [HAC2](~). Attempting to use them at the same time will result in crashes or a white screen when launching the game. Use the older [build 581][581] if you want to combine Chimera with OpenSauce so you can play [.yelo maps](~map#opensauce-yelo-maps).

Chimera works on Windows 7+ and on Linux with Wine 4+.
