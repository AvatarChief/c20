**Invader** is an [open source][invader-repo] modding toolkit for Halo 1 which serves as an alternative or complement to the tools of the [HEK](~) and [H1A Mod Tools](~h1a-ek) with an emphasis on tag data correctness and extending limits where safe. It supports all [editions](~h1#editions-and-versions) like MCC, Custom Edition, Xbox, PC, and Demo but does not support tag extensions from [OpenSauce](~).

{% alert %}
Familiarity with the [command-line](~) is a prerequisite for most of
Invader's tools if you are not using _Six Shooter_ and _invader-edit-qt_.
