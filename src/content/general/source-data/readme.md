Scripts, textures, and models are some examples of source data files.
{% /figure %}
**Source data** are the raw assets which have not yet been converted into [tags](~) useable by the [engine](~blam). They live under the `data` directory of your mod tools and include uncompressed textures, models and animations you have exported from your [3D software](~art-tools#modeling), and level [scripts](~scripting). In most cases, assets within `data` will have a corresponding tag under the same folder layout in `tags`.

Converting these assets into tags is called _importing_ or _compiling_ and is usually done by [Tool](~mod-tools#tools-overview). The types of source data formats used depends on the game; some are common but others are generational. H1-H3/ODST differ between each other, but differ even more compared to later games like Reach, H2A, and H4.
