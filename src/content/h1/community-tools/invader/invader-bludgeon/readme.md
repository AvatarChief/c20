**invader-bludgeon** is a [command-line](~) tool included in the [Invader](~) project. It scans for and attempts to correct [invalid tag data](~tags#invalid-data) within a given tag set. This can be useful when working with tags corrupted by buggy extractors, legacy tags which cause instability in official tools or the game, or when [invader-build](~) does not accept the tag set being used to build a [map](~).

# Usage
See [official documentation][docs] for usage instructions.
