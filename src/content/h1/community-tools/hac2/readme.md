**Halo Anticheat 2** (**HAC2**) is a client mod for Halo Custom Edition. It can be considered an alternative to [Chimera](~) or [OpenSauce's](~opensauce) client features with its own feature set.

# Maintenance
HAC2 was originally an open source mod maintained by Chaosvex, but is now a closed source mod continued by msalerno1965.

# Features
Despite the name, HAC2 is not truly an anticheat mod beyond including a _sightjacker_, which lets you see the game from other players' points of view in real time. While this does offer an unfair advantage, it's also used to help spot aimbotters.

* FOV (Field of view) editor
* Sightjacker
* HUD (Heads up display) editor
* Automatic map downloading via [HaloNet](~sharing#halonet)
