**Mozzarilla** is a tag editor and processor intended to be a complete replacement for Halo Custom Edition's [Guerilla](~), with additional tools and ease of use upgrades, including:

* Edits regular [tags](~h1/tags), [OpenSauce](~) tags, and gametypes
* Loads corrupt tags and view/edit hidden data
* Export/imports [blocks](~h1/tags#blocks)
* Edits tags safely with backups and undo functionality
* Contains a hierarchy view for easily browsing a tags directory
* Switches between multiple tag directories
* Scans for broken tag dependencies and displays tag dependencies
* Displays, validates, and archives tag dependencies

{% alert %}
Mozzarilla was created for Halo Custom Edition modding and may not be compatible with H1A MCC's updated [tags and limits](~h1a-ek#tag-classes), depending on the use case.
