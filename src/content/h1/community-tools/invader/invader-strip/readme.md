about: 'tool:invader-strip'
---
**invader-strip** is a [command-line](~) tool included in the [Invader](~) project. It clears unneeded hidden/junk data from tags and recalculates their CRC32 checksum to ensure the checksum actually matches tag data. This is not the case for some stock [HEK](~) tags so you may need to use this tool to fix tags with bad checksums when using [invader-build](~).

# Usage
See [official documentation][docs] for usage instructions.
