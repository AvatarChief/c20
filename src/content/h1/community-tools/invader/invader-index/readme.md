about: 'tool:invader-index'

**invader-index** is a [command-line](~) tool included in the [Invader](~) project. It builds tag index files from [maps](~map) to be used with the `--with-index` argument of [invader-build](~). This ensures tags in rebuilt maps are stored in the same order as the original to maintain [netcode](~) compatibility.
